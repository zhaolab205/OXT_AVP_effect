# SPED_code
This repository contains code used in my studies

Data: White matter mask, O-SPED, A-SPED, and P-SPED.

Gene_expression: Genetic analysis using the Allen Brain Atlas.

GLM: These scripts are used to process fmri and build GLM models.

Model_PLSR: These scripts are used to build and verify O-SPED, A-SPED, and P-SPED.

Resting_SFC: These scripts are used to calculate static functional connections and analyze resting state data.




The dataset are available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27860538.v1
